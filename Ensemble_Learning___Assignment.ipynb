        "  - Simple models as baselines.\n",

        "- **Better predictive accuracy** → fewer misclassified defaults → lower expected credit losses or more precise risk-based pricing.  \n",
        "- **Reduced variance (bagging)** and **reduced bias (boosting)** → more reliable scoring across cohorts.  \n",
        "- **Feature importance & explainability**: ensembles (esp. Random Forest) give importance measures; explainability tools like SHAP make ensemble decisions interpretable for stakeholders and regulators.  \n",
        "- **Robustness**: ensembles are less brittle to noisy features and dataset shifts.  \n",
        "- **Business calibration**: calibrated probabilities let you set action thresholds consistent with business cost (e.g., manual review vs auto-decline).\n",
